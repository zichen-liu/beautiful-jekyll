![me](/assets/img/my_wide_face.jpg)

Hello! My name is Zichen Liu (*zee-chen lee-oo*) and I'm a biostatistician.

I grew up in the Silicon Valley of California. I attended Pomona College and graduated in 2018 with a BA in chemistry. Then, I moved to rainy Seattle to work as a data professional for a few years before going back to school. A few months ago, I graduated with a MS in biostatistics from the University of Washington. This fall, I will escape the rainy Pacific Northwest and return to sunny California to pursue a PhD in biostatistics at UCLA!
 
Despite pursuing STEM majors and technical roles, I have many artistic hobbies such as creative writing and performing in musical ensembles (as a violinist or an alto). I am also a huge fan of competitive video games and horror movies!
