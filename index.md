Hello! My name is Zichen Liu (*zee-chen lee-oo*) and I'm a (bio)statistician.

I grew up in the Silicon Valley of California. Here's a quick overview of my life:
- 2014-2018: I was Pomona College, pursuing my BA in chemistry
- 2018-2021: I moved to Seattle to work at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as a data professional
- 2020-2022: I stayed at the University of Washington to pursue my MS in biostatistics
- Now: I'm a PhD student in biostatistics at UCLA
 
Despite pursuing STEM majors and technical roles, I have many artistic hobbies such as creative writing and performing in musical ensembles (as a violinist or an alto). I am also a huge fan of competitive video games and horror movies!
