subtitle: Modeling public housing outcomes in King County
---

My classmates from the UW biostatistics MS program and I worked as research consultants. My group, consisting of [Hantong](https://hantongh.github.io/), [Taylor](https://tdkeating.github.io/), [Niki](https://nikipetrakos.github.io/), and myself, had the pleasure of working together with epidemiologists from Public Health -- Seattle and King County on the topic of Housing and Urban Development.

Lack of affordable housing is a public health issue in King County. Our main finding was that different types of exits (positive, neutral, negative) from affordable housing were associated with different risks of experiencing homelessness within 1 year.

Below is the slide deck we presented to the biostatistics department and local public housing experts. It was very rewarding to know that our research was valuable to those who work directly with the populations in need.

We even got featured on the UW biostatistics [department website](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/stories/ms-capstone-students-contribute-public-health-solutions)!
