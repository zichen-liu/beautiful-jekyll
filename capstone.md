subtitle: Modeling public housing outcomes in King County

My classmates from the UW biostatistics MS program and I were arranged into small groups to work as biostatistics consultants on a variety of research projects. My group, consisting of [Hantong](https://hantongh.github.io/), [Taylor](https://tdkeating.github.io/), [Niki](https://nikipetrakos.github.io/), and myself, had the pleasure of working together with epidemiologists from Public Health -- Seattle and King County on the topic of Housing and Urban Development.

Lack of affordable housing is a public health issue, especially in King County. Thus, the big picture goal for the project was to understand how to help people exiting affordable housing achieve better long-term outcomes. Our main findings were that different types of exits were associated with different risks of experiencing homelessness.

Below is the slide deck we presented not only to the biostatistics department but also to staff from the local public housing authorities.

After getting such positive feedback after our presentations, it was very rewarding to know that our research was valuable to those who work directly with the populations in need.

We even got featured on the UW biostatistics [department website](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/stories/ms-capstone-students-contribute-public-health-solutions)!
